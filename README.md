# Overview

This project aims to fully automate the process of creating Reddit narration short videos, similar to those popular on `TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube`. The automation covers every step of the video creation process detailed below:<br>

`searching for story` -> `grabbing comments` -> `comment scoring algo` -> `creating tts (text to speech)` -> `generating post image` -> `rendering video` -> `subtitling video` -> `uploading to youtube`

A detailed blog post with the logic can be found [here](https://meriedith.com/posts/reddit/).
